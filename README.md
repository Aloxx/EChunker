# EChunker
A Faster Object storage for 2d browser games written in JavaScript

# How it can help?
It is very slow to store, use objects in Java-Script in large volumes, since Java-Script is a Single-Thread Language, for faster access to objects by mappings, I wrote the EChunker Library, this will help the code to work 50 times faster.
